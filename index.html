            <p> 
              I was born in Nepal, came to Australia in 2008 and have lived here ever since. Our family follows the Hindu religion, we celebrate most of the main festive periods, like Dashain and Tihar which is one of the main festive period for Nepali people. I speak English very well and can speak Nepali, although I was born in Nepal and lived there for the first 8 years of my life, I have never learnt to write or read in Nepali, I was never good at it in school.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have finished my HSC here, and after HSC I joined Bachelor of Information Systems, I did it for a semester and decided it wasn’t for me and went with my plan B from high school which was getting an Electrical Apprenticeship. I did that for about 2 years and started having physical problems and decided to get back into IT. So, I decided to try Information Technology this time, ended up completing a Diploma of IT, found that interesting and has an area that I am interested in which was web development. Now looking to get my Bachelor in IT. 
              I love playing all sports, but my favourite is soccer. I love watching and playing soccer, my favourite team is FC Barcelona. I have played soccer both in school and outside of school, during my time in high school. But ever since high school finished, I have not had enough time to play, so I just watch now.

                  My interest in IT is mainly web development but would also like to learn more on programming, web development has been my interest since studying Bachelor of Information System. It developed as I was learning Intro to Programming where we had to help a ladybug named Clara to collect mushrooms. It was a very fun class where we learnt something new every week and had challenges to complete. From there I researched more on this and got into web development.

                  I chose RMIT because it was the most flexible course which suits my time schedule. With RMIT I can work and study further because of the online classes, and time the classes are run. Having looked at the course structure, they also offer a lot of subjects that focus on my interest which I believe will help me improve from what I already know. 
                  <br>
                  During my studies I hope to learn important skills to help me land a job in the IT field. I hope to also learn more on Web development and further increase my skills.

                  </p>
                    <p>
                      This position is appealing as it needs  lots of different skills to be able to do the job, the role is challenging which makes it interesting to work at and I will be able to develop even more as a web developer. With the skills needed it will push and motivate me to learn different coding languages.

The job position also requires various work styles and competencies which will develop as I get into the career field. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The skills I currently possess are mainly front end skills, I have been learning front-end developer skills and so far learnt HTML, CSS and little of Javascript, once I have all necessary front-end skills I will then move onto back end learning Php, MySQL, .Net etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My current goal is to follow Traversy Media(Youtube) road map for Web Development 2020(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pThnRneDjw) and learn all the essential technologies listed there, firstly learning Front-end technology and having good idea of it then moving onto Back-end, I would like to learn the following front-end skills before moving onto back-end:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>HTML5 for contents display</li>
                      <li>CSS3 for style the contents</li>
                      <li>Responsive designs to be able to view the website in any device</li>
                      <li>BootStrap for easy web design</li>
                      <li>Javascript to make dynamic pages</li>
                      <li>Sass</li>
                      <li>Learning Github to share codes and easy way to edit code with multiple devices</li>
                      <li>Also JavaScript framework such as React, Angular</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After that move onto learning back-end technology:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Starting with Php, Node.js</li>
                      <li>Learnign MySQL database</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      After learning those, my idea is to look at job adverts and see what is in demand at that stage and learning those technologies, and web development is evolving every year and has different technologies releasing every year, needing developers to stay up to date and learn the latest technology.

                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h5>
                <p>
                  The results show an accurate measure of my personality. It shows that I am an introvert because I am not really outgoing and am very shy, I tend to be more reserved and thoughtful. The way I do things is more observant, and will focus on the current task and learn about something before committing to it. I tend to also like practical work, something that's hands on. I make decisions based on how I feel at the time and follow my gut instinct, this is especially true as the situation I have been in the past, I just did what felt was most reasonable, one example is changing career from Air con and refrigeration to IT.  Lastly, identity being Turbulent, I’m self-conscious and sensitive to stress. But I am a success driven individual that is eager to improve. 
                </p>
                <h5>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>
                <p>
                  In a team environment I like working on tasks that I’m assigned to and will put all my effort into the task, researching the tasks assigned and making sure the project meets all requirements before handing it in. In a team being micromanaged is not my thing, I believe I should be given a task and left to do the tasks, not needing to control every little thing.
                </p>
                <h5>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h5>
                <p>
                  When forming a team, I should look for members with similar identity, who can work individually and complete given tasks without needing to be micromanaged. As for Nature, look for a member that is more of a thinker, as that can benefit greatly on the long run, in a team environment we need to look at the task and make judgement logically not just going with gut feelings. Other then I believe someone extraverted will help in this situation as it will make it easier for all members to get along and helps get rid of shyness.

                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h5>
                <p>
                  Based on the result it confirms that my learning style is auditory. This means that I learn mostly by hearing and listening, and audio information/instruction will help my workflow, as I will remember it better then written instructions. 
                </p>
                <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>
                <p>
                  As an auditory learner, I would like to have group meetings and voice chats rather than emailing and writing notes to each other, I like to explain what I've learned through the voice rather than text. At meetings, I will be good at listening to instructions and know what task is assigned, and have a clear idea of tasks set in my head.
                </p>
                <h5 style="margin-top: 30px;">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h5>
                <p>
                  When forming a team, I can capitalize on my learning style, by listening to members input and writing it down, making notes of what I have learnt for everyone. As my learning style is auditory, I should look for people with different learning styles so we can all have different concepts and inputs during discussion.

                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h5>
                <p>
                  The results confirm that I’m not very creative and my creativity is below par. I think this is an accurate result as creativity has never been my plus point, I would rather have someone design and I make the product then design myself. I lack creativity in writings and designing, where I struggle to come up with something. I’m not a very creative or imaginative person, I struggle at things like writing stories, creating designs such as logos and find it hard to imagine things based on what is read like books.
                </p>
                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>
                <p>
                  Creativity has a major impact on teamwork as I struggle to input anything when brainstorming project ideas or design. But will put extra effort when creating the project. I find it hard to initially come up with an idea but once an idea has been presented I can add to it and think of ways to improve.
                </p>
                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h5>
                <p>
                  When forming a team, it is important to have someone that has creativity to illustrate their point visually, where I can give my input once and add my ideas to it once an idea has been presented.

                <p>
                  I’m passionate about helping the family business, to improve the workflow of it and use skills I have learnt to make day to day things easier. I want to help the family use technology that I studied and have general ideas about and implement those ideas to the shop. As the shop gets busier, and has some tasks that can be automated, I want to help implement those things.

                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">What kind of IT innovation would you like to see? </h5>
                <p>
                  In context to the project, I would like to see an app where people can place orders from the phone as they sit at the table by simply scanning a QR code or downloading the restaurant app. With the app they can make payments and order more, this can also be used to order takeaway and delivery. The original project will be a web app which will then be developed to an app. 
                </p>
                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?</h5>
                <p>
                  Learning front-end and back-end development while building this app will give a great experience and an advantage when applying for an ideal job. This project will be used in the portfolio, and will help employers determine both my front-end and back-end development skills. This project will be a stepping stone towards my ideal job but will require a lot more other projects and experiences before actually getting that job.

                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>
                      The project is a production grade web application that will power a backend and a front end involving both restaurateurs and patrons. The application will be linked to a restaurant website, where customers can sit at the table and place orders and pay via their phone without needing to order at the counter.  Customers can scan QR codes or visit the main website to place an order, once the order has been placed the order is then sent to the restaurant’s dashboard which will be linked to the docket printer. This system’s backend will also integrate to the restaurants’ POS(Point of Sale) system. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When orders are ready and passed out of the kitchen, the staff will have the ability to send a push/sms notification to the customers allowing them to collect the food from the serving area. The customer will also be able to leave real time feedback about the quality of food and services received right on the platform allowing business to strengthen their weakness. Since this platform is a web application built with mobile first approach, the user experience will be very intuitive. This project aims to provide exceptional service to both customers and the business by reducing human errors that may otherwise occur in taking orders.

                    <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Motivation </h5>
                    <p>
                      The motivation behind the project is to help the family business in the technological side. I look for ideas to improve the shop and find ways to fix  problems. Recently we’ve been struggling at busy times with some customers taking too long to order. As customers take longer the wait time increases for others and there are lines of customers while one staff is busy just taking orders and not able to help others. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There are apps out there but all comes at a premium fee, and they lack certain features. There are also multiple online food delivery companies but they all charge hefty fees which forces restaurants to increase food prices to be able to profit from their sales. 
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Description</h5>
                    <p>
                      The project will be a web app linked to the restaurant's main website. Customers can place an order for takeaway from anywhere through the web app but can only order dine-in, if they are seated at a table. Ordering from the app helps restaurants a great deal as it will reduce the amount of staff needed to take orders instead they can use that extra force in the kitchen, this will be especially helpful in busy times. The reduced customer interaction means the restaurant can focus more on the quality of food.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There is a seat reservation function where customers have to sign in to book a table, and the booked table will be displayed as Reserved before a certain time from reserved time. When the table is Reserved customers won’t be able to place an order from that table unless the person that booked orders from their account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In the app each table's QR code will be linked to a table in the POS System. Once a customer enters the shop they will take a seat at the table of their choosing. To view the menu customers will need to scan the QR code at the table or visit the restaurant website then go to order. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Ordering from the table, the customer has access to the full menu and what is being served, can place each item to cart and to place the order they have to pay.  Once payment is received, the order is then sent to the kitchen printer.  Then after the order is ready  the chef can send notification to customers that placed the order via Admin App to let them know that their food is ready and they should pick it up from the counter.           
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Review System - customers can give feedback and rating on their food once they’re done, they can choose to leave review as anonymous, this review will go directly to the restaurant which will help them improve. This will help in keeping a good track record of satisfied customers which will work in favour of the restaurant. This will ensure that the restaurant's food and service is always excellent quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Loyalty System - customers can place orders as guests or register an account which will track how many visits they have had and will be given loyal customer offers(could be monthly specials or discounts after certain amount of orders etc.). Owners can set up loyalty offers via the admin panel, they can run monthly offers or run offers based on orders where after customers have placed orders a certain amount of times on different occasions they will receive a reward. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The admin/owner features will let them access the admin panel where they can make a variety of changes to the menu - they can add new items, remove items, take an item off for the day, add daily specials. They can also view all orders in detail, they can see the customers details which includes name, number, table number they are seated at, and their order. 
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Tools and Technologies</h5>
                    <p>
                      Firstly, as the project is large scale, it will have few people collaborating. Github is a great program to start with for seamless collaboration and Trello is a great way to assign tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For technical skills, knowledge and ideas on different programming languages is required. Knowledge of visual language such as HTML, CSS, Javascript is needed. To make the app work and connect to the server it will require knowledge of server sided languages such as Php, Ruby, Python etc. For database, will need to use MySQL
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To use the service, the customers will need a smartphone that can access the internet. The shop will need a wifi printer, POS System, and a device that can access the web application admin panel for order management.
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Skills Required</h5>
                    <p>
                      There are various skills necessary for the project including design, management, coding, testing and problem solving skills, these are the soft skills needed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Will need to learn how to use Github and Trello for collaboration with others working in the project. Github to share codes and merge all the codes and Trello to assign tasks and keep organised.
                    </p>
